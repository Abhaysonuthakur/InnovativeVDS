An interactive project on **Vehicle Detection** using Machine Learning / Deep Learning techniques.  
This project detects and counts vehicles from video streams or images and provides useful insights through **visualization**.  

---

## 📌 Features
- 🚘 Detect vehicles in images and videos  
- 📊 Count vehicles and generate traffic statistics  
- 🖼️ Real-time bounding box visualization  
- 📉 Data plots for traffic analysis  
- ⚡ Easy to run with Jupyter Notebook
